# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is an assigned variable that needs to pass through the definition.
An argument is actual value or string that will go through the definition.


Researched answer:
Parameter: A parameter is a variable listed in the function definition. It's a placeholder or a named entity that represents a value that the function expects to receive when it is called. Parameters are defined as part of the function signature and act as local variables within the function's scope.
Argument: An argument is the actual value that is passed to the function when it is called. It's the concrete value that is supplied to a function at the time of invocation. Arguments are the specific values assigned to the parameters of a function when the function is called or invoked.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: Object is a set of information to be defined.
Class is a process of making multiple objects.

Researched answer: Class is nothing but a blueprint for an object of it.
Class is a detailed description, the definition, and the template of what an object will be. But it is not the object itself. Also, what we call, a class is the building block that leads to Object-Oriented Programming. It is a user-defined data type, that holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It is the blueprint of any object. Once we have written a class and defined it, we can use it to create as many objects based on that class as we want. In Java, the class contains fields, constructors, and methods. For example, consider the Class of Accounts. There may be many accounts with different names and types,  but all of them will share some common properties, as all of them will have some common attributes like balance, account holder name, etc. So here, the Account is the class.

Object is an instance of a class. All data members and member functions of the class can be accessed with the help of objects. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated, but memory is allocated when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created). For Example, considering the objects for the class Account are SBI Account, ICICI account, etc.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: Repeating method

Researched answer: An Iteration in computer science is a function that repeats a block of code in a specified order, often until a specific result occurs. Algorithms use iterations to run a program repeatedly until it meets certain conditions or until the algorithm repeats a set number of times.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: The process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. React State: A JavaScript library used to build webpages, mobile web pages, and even native mobile applications. It was created by Facebook as that application grew and became more dynamic. It is component based, which means that we use it to build many small parts that are joined together to form an entire application. This feature turns out to be extremely scalable.

2. React Props: rops (properties) are specialized React objects used to pass information from one component to another. Props create a unidirectional flow of data and behavior from one component down to a nested component via the component invocation. While state values are constantly updated through user interactions, props cannot be changed. They are a "read only" value.

3. JSX: JSX is JavaScript flavored markdown that behaves very similarly to HTML.
